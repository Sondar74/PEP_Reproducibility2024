# Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (BBM) Equation

The code in this directory is used to create the data for the BBM equation.
First, start Julia in this directory. On Linux and macOS, you can do this
by running

```bash
julia
```

in the terminal. Then, you can execute the following code in the Julia REPL:

```julia
julia> include("code_bbm.jl")

julia> main()
```

This will print some output to the screen.
